          <h2>Section 1</h2>
          <p class="lead">Hartford and its surrounding areas are home to nearly 900,000 people. This includes people from all demographics and races, and within a world that is constantly inventing and evolving there is only one thing that is moving at the same rate as our humanity. The answer is our waste and recycling products. It is known that all around the world, the amount of recycling being produced has only increased as time goes on. We are currently living in a plastic-age of life. Let it be known that nearly half of the plastic ever made in the world has only been made in the past 13 years. But how does this affect us? How does this affect the town that I am living in? How much am I contributing to this issue?    Well let's take a look within our own backyard and see how responsible we, the people in the surrounding Hartford area, are for this. </p>

       

          <iframe title="Recyclables Produced by Town (Including Municipalities) in Hartford Area" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-7monD" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7monD/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="662" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

          <p>ADD CAPTIONS like this -- Figure 1: Explores the total tons of recycling in Hartford including the municipalities. This also includes the pounds per person per year and per day. </p>

          <h2>Data and Google Sheet</h2>
          <p>   <p>  This Spreadsheet expresses the required data that will be utilized to show the discrepancy between residential recyclables total and residential with municipalities total. This data may seem overwhelming but it will be broken down in easier visualizations to help illustrate the discrepancies and the data expressed in the spreadsheet . The first stage of this design is to find out how much municipalities affected the number of recyclables near Hartford. This allows us to separate the commercial numbers from the residential, allowing for more accurate data per person without an inflated rate for municipalities. The data used for this will be illustrated in this map and, for reference, it is using the first 5 columns on the Google Sheet screenshot.<p>

          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>

          <img src="sample-zbib1.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 1: After inserting a URL into the ZBib.org tool, you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details.</i></p>

          <img src="sample-zbib2.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 2: Clicking the Edit button in ZBib allows you to enter or correct missing details, such as the full Website Title.</i></p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h4>Works Cited:</h4>

          <p>Lurye, Rebecca. “New Housing Code in Hartford Would Keep Slumlords from Hiding Behind LLCs.” Hartford Courant, May 31, 2019. <a href='https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-housing-code-20190531-hcke2jo2x5fpdgz75xf4hlv2ki-story.html'>https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-housing-code-20190531-hcke2jo2x5fpdgz75xf4hlv2ki-story.html</a>.</p>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>
